/**
 * Tool-input typing bridge.
 *
 * Claude Agent SDK ships per-tool input schemas via the `sdk-tools`
 * subpath export (`BashInput`, `FileReadInput`, `GrepInput`, …) but
 * does NOT model the link between a tool's `name` string and its
 * input shape. The widget switch in `StreamMessage.tsx` and the
 * permission preview in `PermissionCard.tsx` both discriminate on
 * tool name and then read fields off `content.input` (typed as
 * `unknown` upstream). This file closes the gap so each branch can
 * narrow once and read typed fields downstream.
 *
 * Single source of truth: `KNOWN_TOOL_NAMES` is a const tuple of the
 * PascalCase tool names we model. Everything else derives from it —
 * the `KnownToolName` literal-union type, the lowercased
 * `TOOLS_WITH_WIDGETS_LOWER` Set used by the tool-result suppression
 * path in `StreamMessage.tsx`, and the runtime `isKnownToolName`
 * guard. Adding a tool is a one-touch change to the tuple plus an
 * entry in `ToolInputByName` (which the compiler enforces via the
 * `<K extends KnownToolName>` constraint on `asToolInput`).
 *
 * Tools NOT shipped under `sdk-tools` as of 0.2.141 — `LS`, `TodoRead`,
 * `MultiEdit` — get local interfaces that mirror exactly what our
 * widgets read. Swap to the SDK type if a future release adds them.
